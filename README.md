ltt - Linux Time Tracker 

# What is it?

Basically [ManicTime](https://www.manictime.com) for Linux. If you're not familiar with ManicTime, there's a nice video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lBCzW9P5mY) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Wp24Lr37k).

# How to use

...to be written...

# Features 

Todo:

- Track computer usage (idle vs active), like the activity timeline in ManicTime
- Track name of active window
- Track application usage, like the application timeline im ManicTime
- Allow applications and websites to be tagged into groups so you can tag games as procrastination and IDE as programming for summary statistics
- Produce nice tagging UI that hides already-tagged websites and duplicates as well as allows you to drag or multi-select (like ctrl-click) websites to tag multiple websites together
- Produce nice summary statistics showing how much active time you spent in each application, which documents you spent time editing, which websites you spent most time on, which tags you spent time on etc
- Produce more powerful browser history, showing days and times where a particular URL was visited and for how long it was visited each day. 
- Summary for individual days, weeks, months and so on. Allow users to select a date range that the statistics will be computed over. 
- Allow for easy browsing over each day to see day duration, active times, top applications, top documents (including websites). 
- Maybe track individual documents as well (not sure how ManicTime does it)
- Maybe produce a nice chart/UI like ManicTime does
- Tags timeline, except instead of just tags it will be an "event" (/task) with category, tags and description


# Why did I make this? 

Because ManicTime doesn't have a Linux version, and I don't want to give up the convenience of Linux just so I can have a proper time tracking software. 

# Feature requests

This software is mainly for my own use. It is supposed to be used by individuals to track their own time (as an alternative to browser history perhaps), not by employers to monitor their employees.  

If you want a feature, ask for it. If I think it's useful, then I'll implement it. If I think it's useless, then either implement it yourself or pay me to implement it. 

I will not be maintaining this for distros that I'm not using. I'm currently using Ubuntu 16.04, so this software is only checked to work on Ubuntu 16.04. When I upgrade to a new distro (either Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04) then this will be updated appropriately.
